def calcDistance(speed, time):
    """
    calculates the distance an object travels
    
    """
    return speed * time

# 2. implement the following function
def addFraction(num1, den1, num2, den2):
    """
    -------------------------------------------------------
    Calculates and returns fraction values.
    Use: num, den, product = addFraction(num1, den1, num2, den2)
    -------------------------------------------------------
    Parameters:
        num1 - numerator of first fraction (int)
        den1 - denominator of first fraction (int != 0)
        num2 - numerator of second fraction (int)
        den2 - denominator of second fraction (int != 0)
    Returns:
        num - numerator of sum (int)
        den - denominator of sum (int)
        sum - num / den (float)
    --------

# 3. implement the following function
def bulkOrder(quantity, price):
    """
    -------------------------------------------------------
    Calculates and returns the total cost of a bulk order.
    If you order less than 5 items you must pay full price
    If you order between 5 and 10 items you get a 10% discount
    If you order more than 10 items you get a 20% discount
    Use: total = bulkOrder(quantity, price)
    -------------------------------------------------------
    Parameters:
        quantity - number of items ordered (int > 0)
        price - price per item (float > 0)
    Returns:
        total - total cost of the order (float)

# 4. write a function, checkNumber, and docstring that does the following:
# - Takes an integer as a parameter
# - If the integer is even and greater than or equal to 50, return "thats a really big even number!"
# - If the integer is odd and greater than or equal to 50, return "thats a really big odd number!"  
# - If the integer is even and less than 50, return "thats a small even number!"
# - If the integer is odd and less than 50, return "thats a small odd number!"
# Follow up question: Do we need an else case in the above function? Why or why not?
