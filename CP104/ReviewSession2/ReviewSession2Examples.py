# 1.  write a docstring for the following function:

    return speed * time

# 2. implement this function

    -------------------------------------------------------
    Calculates and returns fraction values.
    Use: num, den, product = add_fraction(num1, den1, num2, den2)
    -------------------------------------------------------
    Parameters:
        num1 - numerator of first fraction (int)
        den1 - denominator of first fraction (int != 0)
        num2 - numerator of second fraction (int)
        den2 - denominator of second fraction (int != 0)
    Returns:
        num - numerator of sum (int)
        den - denominator of sum (int)
        sum - num / den (float)

# 3. write a function, check_number, and docstring that does the following:
# - Takes an integer as a parameter
# - If the integer is even and greater than or equal to 50, return "thats a really big even number!"
# - If the integer is odd and greater than or equal to 50, return "thats a really big odd number!"  
# - If the integer is even and less than 50, return "thats a small even number!"
# - If the integer is odd and less than 50, return "thats a small odd number!"
# Follow up question: Do we need an else case in the above function? Why or why not?
